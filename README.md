## Overview

In this web app, employees can submit their business trip proposal. HRD then can review employees' proposal and decide whether to accept or reject them.

Employees will get business trip allowance per day accordingly with its distance classification, where:
<div>
<ul>
<li>Distance 0 â€“ 60km: no allowance</li>
<li>Above 60km but in one province get IDR 200,000 per day</li>
<li>Over 60km outside the province but still on one island get IDR 250,000</li>
<li>Over 60km outside the province and outside the island get IDR 300,000</li>
</u>
</div>

The distances are calculated from the lat-lon of the city of origin and destination, which is obtained automatically from Geocoding API.
